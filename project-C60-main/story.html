<h1>Lal Bahadur Shastriâ€™s Short Story on Honesty</h1>

<h2><p>When Lal Bahadur Shastri was serving as the prime minister of India, he went to a textile mill. He requested the owner of the mill to show him some Sarees for his wife. The owner showed him some exquisite sarees. When Shastri ji asked the price, he found them too expensive. He asked for cheaper sarees. The owner showed him cheaper sarees. But, Shastri ji still found them expensive. The owner was surprised and told him that he need not worry about the prices as he was the prime minister of India and it would be his privilege to give the sarees to him as gift.</p>

<p>To this Shastri ji replied that he could not accept such expensive gifts and he would only take a saree that he could afford.</p></h2>
